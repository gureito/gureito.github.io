title: to whom i've left behind
---

i like you.
and i miss you --probably every one of you--.

it's just.
i'm really bad at keeping in touch with people.

without warning, i withdraw from the world.
things get tangled up inside my mind, and when i realize...

that email has been sitting there for weeks, answer drafted but unsent.
that text message, i haven't even read it yet, has it really been months?

not good at all.

knowing me as long as i have it's time to admit: this miss-handling of you --on an individual basis-- will not change.
and i'm sorry.

i won't promise to try and do better and this time really keep in touch regularly with each of you; i know i won't.

i promise that if you ping me --on any contact you have of me-- i will ping you back in a timely manner.

i won't promise to wax poetic about my life and ask every detail about yours.

but i promisse to ping you back.

and i'm working myself up to regularly post updates about what's going on with me.
like a journal.
perhaps that will let my overthinking mind to someday stop, breath and just reach out to you: "how are things?"

that, i hope.
