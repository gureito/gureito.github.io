i hereby apply for a volunteer position at `Roguelike Celebration`,
even if i'm not really sure how i can contribute.

i enjoy learning about roguelikes, PCG, and game design in general,
even if i've failed to actualize almost all of what i've scribbled in notepads and mulled over and over inside my head.
but over the years, each roguelike celebration nudges me an step closer to this and now i want to pay it back (forward?), 
even if just a bit at a time.

i find myself most proficient at writing code and adapting to any particular --except maybe purely a functional-- coding style,
and enjoy talking with users and stakeholders about how they expect things to be like, or what pain points might me.
i've written code in professional settings in VBScript, Java, and AS3; scientific code in python and matlab; prototyped interactive simulations in fortran, c, python, zig, rust, and javascript; and automated repetitive --or environment-- tasks in bash and python.
once, i even made a little cd tool that installed an offline version of an educational games portal with a customized firefox, for use in schools with very bad internet connection.

i realize that most of the coding volunteering can be done via prs to the github repo, but i wanted to let you know in case something not social space related shows up and you need extra digits to help.

other than coding, i enjoy --and have been practicing more than coding-- wordsmithing.
i've yet to try copy-writing, or writing on spec, but those are challenges i'm actually a bit eager to engage with.

i'm not very good at chatting with people, and talking to a camera can be quite difficult, i would need some time to prepare myself for any of that, and would be hard pressed to do any of these in the spot, without warning.

----

in short, i've enjoyed the benefits of the conference enough.
it's time i engage in a more active way with the community, and would love to at least try to do whatever you folks need help with.
if it's of any importance, i currently live in Calgary, but for now --that might change in time for next year-- i don't have a car ðŸ˜…

thank you for the amazing work you folks have done,
