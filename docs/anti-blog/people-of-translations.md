"what is this ground?" from-jonah-of-the-kiln da-thumps in anxiousness.
even though all of-the-kiln are near, the rustle of the tools against the brushes and their sweaty-earthy smell reassuring, they can discern just one other muffled step-talk.
"why can i hear no one else?" from-jonah dada-thumps then turns to their closest companion, hoping to smell their identity, giving up on recognizing their gait.
it's mother.
from-jonah mouth-sings relief as mother nuzzles them.
"there, there, come, come" jonah-of-the-kilns swish-thumps close to their feet, then again and again until they stop shaking and ta-thump back "i am well mother. where are we?"

"you were sleep when the translation happened, that is disorienting, isn't it?"

"yes. i couldn't feel the grass anymore, the ground is difficult to listen to and smells like bad water. i don't want to translate anymore." from-jonah pa-thumps with finality.

jonah mouth-sings exasperation and nuzzles them again.

"not all translations are this bad, and it is better if you're awake. you will try to be awake next time, won't you?" jonah tata-thumps.

"yes, mother, i will" from-jonah ta-thumps.

"come now, the elders know of this place, we will find better ground up the slope, but need to keep close together and pay attention," jonah tata-thumps, "this is important," papa-thump, "warning will travel slow on this ground, you need to listen with your ears to noises you don't know, not just step-talk," pa-thump, "tell me when you hear anything," pata-thump.

from-jonah-of-the-kilns nuzzles their mother back, mouth-singing resoluteness as they move out.

"this was bad for your first translation, but you will get used to it, then learn our histories." jonah sings resolve da-thumping for only they to hear "then perhaps you will open ways yourself one day."
