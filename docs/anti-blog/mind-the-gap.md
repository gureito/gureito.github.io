title: mind the gap
---
you say of things that behave in unexpected (unexplainable) ways that they are haunting (haunted).
but to haunt is to occupy a place you are not supposed to be, to exist when you should not.
a sense of uneasiness, the gap between the expected and the unexpected, the wanted and the scorned, the comforting and the scaring.
that's where you find us.

it's a place like the gap between the train and the platform when you need to take that single step to enter the train and you hesitate.
"Mind the gap!" the speakers would blare in London bellow, and like that gap, a haunting feeds on -- and draws out -- the irrational.
we revel when we are not paid attention to.
like tripping into a train, a good haunting best happens when you're looking elsewhere.

And now i must excuse myself, and, while i appreciate your offer, i must refuse.
you invited me here.
you opened the doors and let me in.
you showed me around.

i am wanted here.
i am expected.
i can't haunt you.

so, good tidings to you.
someday, we will catch up.

your unesteemed interlopers.
