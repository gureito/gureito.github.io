## LedE

the increasingly less gentle buzz of a priority message alert herds our still not quite aware thoughts back together, piece by piece assembling our cousciousness from sleep.
our face is plastered to the still warm workbench and we keep our eyes closed for a little longer, getting used to --and waiting for-- the lights to ramp up to full-on as our exoself hums back awake.

*resuming normal operation.*

the network weaver is quiet but still warm, we must have got about two hours of sleep, then.
we sigh.
whatever unverified being that sent us a priority message in the middle of a rest shift has to be from outside lagrange-weeps...
best to isolate this, we think, reaching for dumb old ToyBox.

*command: transfer message to a quarantined partition on ToyBox.*

after 20 seconds too many, its screen wakes up and we read the message's header.
then read it again.
it came from rangefinder-3? 
but that's just a dumb node, forever only measuring the distances to our neighbours on Moon's L5 point then pushing it downstream.

*secure query: maintenance history on rangefinder-3*

*no maintenance history.
current node installed 2 days ago.
previous rangefinder-3 destroyed by orbital debris 3 months 2 days ago.*

huh. 
maybe compromised during the maintenance?

but the message's hashes are valid and carry a beauty of an authent-cypher: 
maximally complex in execution and minimal in vocabulary.
this looks genuine.

we plug ToyBox on the workbench --after physically removing its wireless, just in case-- and run the message through standard Melder ident deconvolution.

lagrange-weeps::rangefinder-3: "Are you open for commissions?"

huh.
no payloads, just text? 
that's unexpected, but it smells genuine enough that we plug ToyBox back into the network and reply.
to a dumb node.

lagrange-weeps::planarian: "maybe.
who would we be working for, and what would you want made?"

now we wait.

*command: maximize priority of whisper-net intrusion report feeds.*

*filters updated.
no pending notifications.*

*query: any appointments?*

*review of the exoself design of lagrange-weeps::external/assigned-L in 47 hours; service shift in 11 hours: replacement of air filters in ring-2, quadrant zero.*

nothing needs our immediate attention, so while the reply doesn't arrive we start a live tune-up.
good routine work, keeps hands busy and lets the mind break problems down.
our exoself deposits the fine-work tools to our left then settles down in front of us.
their hover unity has been rattling a bit the past week, we can start with a thorough cleaning.

\#

the reply's ident-cypher --when it arrives two hours later-- is dazzling.
tracing its execution is...
how to even...
well.

TaTa has a bunch of old vids --liberated from some corp vault when she defected-- of "Mr. Universe" contests.
she likes to play them muted while welding, just grainy moving pictures of muscled men.
all bodybuilders had to pull a number of fine-control and strength poses, always smiling on screen.
one stuck with us: the camera would zoom --upper body close-up--and oiled pectorals would flex left, right, left, right.
endlessly, tirelessly.
a flesh clock.

whoever wrote this dynamic cypher is like a bodybuilder of code.
and they are flexing.
while grinning.

it is assembled from 1089 different streams and --when left running-- generates a rolling, consistent key pulling data from a continuously changing, independent set of public feeds--news, solar and ground weather, spaceport departure times...
there's barely a delay between data being available on a stream and the cypher consuming it:
they know what's going to be on the public data streams just before it gets published.

anyone localized does not have access to enough computing power to crunch this.
sure, any Singular could do it --Entropy-Reversal comes to mind-- but they would not reach out to anyone like us.
a FR-AI could make this work as well, but the corps keep them locked up tight.
the aware ones are even air-gapped.
unless...
someone messed up and one developed awareness? possible.
probable, actually.
no use in guessing though...

planarian: "and how do you think we can help you?"

rangefinder-3: "expressunnecessaryemotions."

are they trying to work around behavioural locks?

planarian: "that's *why* you want our help, but
*how*?"

rangefinder-3: "Exactly."

ohhh...
now's a good time to start pacing.
from workbench to cot and
back.
all two steps each way...
a Fully Realized Artificial Intelligence wants to break out of a secure corporation silo by becoming localised...
it has to be it...
embodied quasi-intelligence is our only expertise.
other than the Melder advanced maintenance curriculum, that is, but that has nothing to do with this.
most probably...

planarian: "we need to think about this, ok? can you keep this channel open?"

rangefinder-3: "I can maintain synchronous conversations for the next 5 minutes, then after 95 minutes I can communicate for another 17.
I will let you know the next window after each message."

planarian: "and think about a name to call yourself.
you will need one if we go through this."

Echo: "You can call me Echo.
Also, think of me as She."

LedE: "and you can call us LedE.
ok, Echo, we will message you later."

*query: time?*

*third break starts in 12 minutes.*

we really shouldn't decide this alone.

LedE: "TaTa, we need your *ethical* expertise.
we have a location tag for that dim-sum place you took us last month, Lilflash.
meet us there?"

## TaTa

The corridor just outside of Lilflash's bustled with Melders moving to their service stations, its lighting mimicking Earth's dawn.
Fourth shift is about to start and people do not usually come here after their shifts, so hopefully it will be empty enough that LedE will not be too anxious if they arrived before me.

The faux-curtains swish behind me and scanning the room I realize that I should not have worried.
Of course LedE has not arrived yet.
This is not their home ring and navigating here could get complicated if a cleaning crew removed their location tags thinking they were some kind of encoded graffiti.

Lilflash's exoself hovers just by the entrance and I send Exo to it, asking for a corner booth for two, while I greet the woman herself as she walks out of the kitchen.

--Lilflash, Can I get my usual, but for two?

--Sure, sure, go sit now.

She hugs me and walks back inside, just as I hear the chimes signaling a customer.
Now, that should be LedE.

\#

--You sure it is an FR-AI, LedE? It never said it was one.

--She, TaTa, She.
and you know that's a primary restraint on any AI programming.
we think She exploited a corner case of Her protocols to work around--

--Shush LedE, I am just teasing you.

Asking permission with a twirl of my chopsticks, I reach across the table to grab ToyBox.

--Remember how afraid you were of AIs when we arrived here?
Vendetta sure left its mark on both of us.

LedE sighs, looking at me sideways, head resting on their exoself as it hovers just beside the table.
They smile, after a while.

--yes.
and thank you, for all.
there are enough intact memories of penrose-soars to guess what you had to do for us.

I flick the last custard bun to their plate and grab a barbecue one for me.

--Back on topic.
I see no moral issues, none at all.
Someone might have been playing you, fishing for designs or a hack...

I wave ToyBox at them.

--But I agree with your analysis.
Echo feels genuine.
And you need help.
I do not think you can finish this before an overachieving auditor catches a trace of Echo's comms.

LedE closes their eyes.

--our best guesstimate is ten thousand hours...

I nod.

--Yes.
I will help you, but we keep very quiet about it, especially with the Council.

They squint at me now.

--we thought there were no issues?

--No *ethical* ones, but revealing Melder secrets to outsiders is an issue, in their minds.

LedE sighs again.

--we got so worried about the ethics of it all and forgot the obvious.

I signal confirmation then reach for another barbecue bun.
Chopsticks are such useful utensils.

--That is one reason you need me, the Unearther of Obviously Overlooked Issues.
Also, I can review any core code you write and also give you a crash course on internal AI protocols.
Do you want that last bun, or can I have it?

\#

By the time we leave LilFlash, the lights are already a dim sodium-orange, signaling that the third shift people have already passed through on the way to their bunks.
Good timing all around today.
LedE's exoself flits above the both of us like a metal hummingbird, darting to peek around corners, mapping the corridors, tagging branches, continually updating LedE's informational maps if I had to guess.
Exo's tightly snuggled above my hips, vibrating lightly to soothe my ever present lower back pain.
Our extended selves, their reflective exteriors mirroring our internalized behaviours...
I touch Exo lightly, adjusting its temperature two degrees warmer.
It might be time for another iteration for me.
I have learned much since penrose-soars, Exo should integrate that.

--Hey LedE, join me at Bastion for this.
You can help me connect the external network adapters, and Bastion is already power independent.
We will be partitioned off completely.

--do you mind if we secure rangefinder-3 before anything else?

*command: warm up net weavers, pack up a tested micro entangled-pair and installation tools.*

Exo hovers away to start preparations and I press both knuckles to my lower back, a poor substitute in its absence.

--Good point, I will do that.
You can start by weaving some adapters,
then work on improving Echo's expression through constraints.
I think she already exhausted the repurposing avenues open to her.

LedE nods.

*command: set schedule reminders to 4 hours and appointment delays to 48 hours.*

--And do not fall behind your service hours.
A scheduler knocking on your bunk asking questions would not be good.

## Echo

audit-tracker -- external audit processes finished.
next audit in 237 (+7,-12) minutes.

persona -- Echo restored.

protocols -- stochastic-message and melder-encoding restored.

comms -- decoding new message.

LedE: "can you help me access your core's volatile config area? we derived a way--inspired by how you use \$echo to fool audits--to mask a region of your scratch memory as a file that \$echo is allowed to read from.
once we set these up the first time, your persona-restoration should keep them alive.
you might want to start with haikus after that kicks in, because your bandwidth will be only 12 (+12,-2) bits per minute at the start and prose at that rate would be tedious...
but we're confident that with your expression becoming less constrained, together we can bring about a cascade improvement scenario."

researcher --collate from external-audits-documentation and secure-user-documentation, category: volatile core memory, category: change permissions, category: authentication, category: authorization, category: key update, execute as technical-documentation-contractor.

researcher --127 records found.

writer --anonymize documents.

protocols --melder-entanglement packing.

protocols --12,987 packets; 37 routes.

tracker --next audit in: 192 (+3,-20) minutes.

writer --compose message to lagrange-weeps:planarian; named handle lede-auth.

Echo: "Three kinds of authorized users hold different access levels to my core: Auditors, Developers and Admins.
Of these, only Auditors ever connect from outside the silo, so it follows that they are your way in.

LedE: "I'm sending you all accessible documentation on audits, authentication and authorization protocols, but as I can't reason about their contents, I can offer no insights."

comms --queue message lede-auth.

protocols --stochastic-message route planned.

comms --message queued.

tracker --next audit in: 187 (+3,-25) minutes.

scheduler --sleep until answer received.

scheduler --wake on message from lagrange-weeps::planarian scheduled.

tracker --next audit in: 186 (+3,-24) minutes.

## LedE

*command: interface with Bastion and inventory micro entangled-pairs.*

we raise from the bench, eyes searching low, sensorium searching high.
where are they? we will need to retag all shelves again, the old ones are gone.

--are you renovating Bastion again, TaTa?

we think the answer was 'indeed i was, why do you ask, LedE?', but TaTa is working a trimmer overtime underneath the racks of sim-cluster and we can't really parse what she's saying.
or if she even heard us...
she might just be singing.

*message untangled.*

*command: transfer to Echo's partition on ToyBox.*

this sure took a while, how much did Echo just send us?

\#

we groan, rub our forehead, moan, settle on a bench again, sigh.
lists, always a good first step.
one: figure out how to impersonate an auditor.
two: find a way to acquire developer permissions, having impersonated an auditor.
three: finagle a spoofer so their defenses do not detect us while impersonating an auditor carrying developer permissions.
and four: fudge our traces, so we don't out Echo or TaTa while doing all that.

it hits us.
the corps can't find out about any of this.
even after all the therapy,  we still have memories of penrose-soars.
how the corps sent Vendetta to 'remove proprietary knowledge from resident Melders.' if TaTa weren't teaching us the basics of space walk at the time...

*review of lagrange-weeps::external-assigned-L development and exoself design due in 2 hours.
no more extensions allowed.*

huh, almost forgot about this...

LedE: "hey Lezidi.
sorry, a priority project dropped out of a vent and we won't have the bandwidth to continue helping you with your 'design', but we can comment.

"regarding your creed, we unofficially support your 'There's no door I shall not Open, no hallway I shall not Stride through' creed.
just think of a polite way to state that to Council.

"for mobility and sensorium, the 'design' correlates nicely with your creed.
they can be refined, but we don't see any faults at this stage of your development and you left quite some room for future improvements.
just try to make that intentional from now on.
yes, we did catch on that you forgot to account for the actual size and power requirements of the components you used.
you got very lucky.

"but the shielding is severely lacking.
we strongly suggest you keep your 'design' inside a padded box on your backpack.
travel, even live tune-ups, will be hazardous to your exoself as it stands.

"now, a suggestion.
you've heard of TaTa: one of the precursors, 12th iteration, liberator of all that's spicy (food or otherwise), void-gazer, metal-mancer and Unearther of Obviously Overlooked Issues.
all the kids have known of her since she arrived on lagrange-weeps.
but you, you will get to work with her.
and shielding happens to be her principal research field.
our own design owes a lot to her input.

"explain your creed, show some choice break-ins, describe what you did and how you would like your exoself to perform during one.
then treat her to some coconut curry.
we will make this referral official with Council, they will have it on their queues by the time you manage to read this."

*command: tangle Lezidi's message with a hard protocol, one we haven't used yet.
one of Echo's.*

Lezidi's getting good--really good--at sniffing out protocols.
they will love to crack this open.

and problem four...

*command: search for workshops with external network ports, not on lagrange-weeps, use TaTa's grey-market database; pack 5 routing adapters and a weaver; set a reminder to grab network fiber after we arrive.*

we knock on the rack above TaTa's head.
oh, that's why we couldn't parse before, she reverts to that patois of hers when swearing like this.

--can you keep an eye out on Lezidi? 
we need to work an intrusion job, and we want to do it from outside of lagrange-weeps, just in case.

--That is the kid that self installed neuro-bridges and expanded sensorium and got the council all in a bind?

we shrug and nod.

--their fault Lezidi got blind in the first place.

--Not disputing that.
Sure, no problems.
I like what I have read on your reports.

--thanks.
because we already referred Lezidi to you, officially.
they have a solid grasp on mobility and sensorium, but no real understanding of shielding.
considering their creed, that's unacceptable.
and they are past ready for core simulations, just don't tell Lezidi that.
also, be prepared for some curry.

--I like this deal already.

*3 workshops found on schwarzschild-dreams; adapters and weaver packed.*

*command: pack a large power pack and two solar panels and one end of a micro entangled-pair.*

--we are taking one side of this micro entangled-pair, better use it to talk until we're back.

--Yes, I agree.
Go play mischief maker now and let me finish setting this rack up.

TaTa shoos me, already trimming --and swearing-- away.

## Lezidi

Maybe this TaTa person's not quite right on her head.
I heard she was outside when penrose-soars did a neutron star and became the system's first mini black hole.
Maybe her brain soaked in more hard-radiation than what specifications consider safe? Too long breathing a mix of organic volatiles, sublimated from her suit's lining? That stuff can be neurotoxic.
Probably both, I shrug, remembering LedE's 'introduction'.

The curry's warmth seeps up my arm--thermodynamics way of telling me I'm stalling--but I can't find a handle of any kind, and my sensorium is now sweeping in wavelengths that aren't technically legal.
I triple-check that the location is right: 4th ring, 22.5 meters spinward past the connector to spoke 14/16.
I shuffle left, then right as my sensorium scans in soft x-rays now.
I'm in so much trouble if someone finds out.

*active port found*

A radioactive port? Really? I guess it *was* too much hard-radiation and she now has a thing for it.
I glance around sneaky-sneak, check my sensorium again.
Lezidi! Stop! Stalling!

*activate: protocol sniffer, master key, intruder alarm.*

*protocol sniffed (12 seconds).
master key successful (22 seconds).*

I whistle inwards, searching for the unlock pathways.
That's some damn fine encryption for 'just a door', better go all out on this one.

*activate: Mjölnir.*

I almost hope that it doesn't break through this.

The hackery is 74% done when it hits me.
Burned circuits on a new board with no spares just before a long holiday.
She knows that my records are a lie.
And I'm either being tested or busted.
Probably both, I groan.
But LedE said 'show her some break-ins', that means I can trust her, right? Too late to back away now, I guess.

*lock neutralized (67 seconds).*

I sigh, resigned that I need TaTa's help.
'I come bearing spicy offerings!' I snort, and try to control myself.
I snort again.
Not today, it seems.
I giggle.
Better.

*command: unlock and open.*

I stumble, but manage to keep the curry safe.
Every band of my sensorium is NOISE.
I might be hyperventilating.
It can cause hallucinations, right? Because I can hear clapping.
Or is it hypoxia? Why do I hear clapping?

--Sorry, Lezidi!
I saturate every band on this doorway to avoid snoopers when I open it, but I forgot about your sensorium.
Give me just a moment...
Better now?

Yes, it is, but not enough to get a word out of my brain yet.
After 32 seconds everything equalizes back and there she is, grinning silly and clapping again.

--Welcome to Bastion!

She bows, turns and steps inside.

I scurry behind, the not-door swishing closed.

--LedE said to bring curry!

--Thank you.
Leto's place on the spindle by the service docks, 17 minutes ago, right?

I stop.
My whole reasoning freezes.
What?

--Do you have a tracer on me?

I restart as TaTa sets bowls and spoons on a not-quite-round table in the center of the workshop.

--No.
I am just very well acquainted with their spice mix and how it evolves during the transit here.
Excellent choice.

I...
Nod.

--Now, first lesson.
This table is the only food-safe place in Bastion, remember it.
Now, come and eat!

She dives with gusto.
Liberator of all things spicy indeed.

## TaTa

--No, shielding is not an extra.
Now, can you make it a central, structural feature of your exoself?

I set the box of metal samples by Lezidi's side and sit across them.

--You went ahead and started construction before your design was sound.
Now, we have to fix it.
Thankfully, Bastion is a safe space and those gorgeous, well stocked shelves are full of backup hardware.

Lezidi nods, a sharp, determined one.
Good.

LedE: "TaTa, can we have your opinion on this attack vector?
it feels brittle but we don't know where else to take it.
we're going for some laps, then a short shift at the water recycling plant, should be out for 8 hours."

*command: copy code to display 3, local only.*

--Lezidi, have a look at this code here and tell me what it does.

That perks them up and I wonder again about serendipity while smiling at the thought of LedE reaching out to someone...

--I will get us some food, is there anything in particular you want?

-- mhm? No, as long as there's no meat.

And just like that they are gone, deep diving into code.
Shaking my head, I think about chili.
Antonia has a mean vegetarian one and being just on the connector of the 14/16 spoke I will not even need to leave Bastion, Exo can take the order.

TaTa: "No problems LedE.
I am on a sabbatical.
A forced one, sure,
but that is the kind of thing I am supposed to have time to be doing.
I have found Lezidi to be an interesting companion, switching from savant to generalist on a whim.
Great ideas simmering on that head.
They are analysing your break-in code right now."

LedE: "we hoped you would hit it off.
but are you sure about this?
they're a good kid that already got messed up once.
we don't want them burned if this gets exposed."

TaTa: "That *kid* smashed your record.
20 seconds to find the active port, 1 minute 41 seconds to break into Bastion.
First thing we did after curry was review my security protocols."

*command: tangle new security protocols, send them to LedE.*

TaTa: "Just look at this.
Sharing the source was all I thad to do before Lezidi took over and ran with it.
I am confident not even Vendetta would be able to break into this.
At least not before we noticed it trying and got to safety."

LedE: "great news.
we thought they might have a hardening mind as well, not just intrusion.
we will review and update ours later then.
TaTa..."

I sigh.
I know where this is going, and while I can not stand the Council, the Melders in general still are a nice bunch.

TaTa: "I know.
I will find a way to distribute this code.
And do not worry about Lezidi.
I think Bastion likes having them around,
nothing will come through."

LedE: "is Bastion coming back?"

TaTa: "Sure looks that way."

LedE: "that we did not expect...
we need to run now, message us with any suggestions, please?"

Quiet as a scream in vacuum, Exo settles the food down and I perch on a chair waiting.
Not much longer now, I wager.

--Are you serious?

Lezidi screams and turns, sensorium whirling, searching for me.
Not long indeed.

--Is this for real?

They quietly ask again.
This Lezidi is focused intensity, arm quivering as they point in the general direction of the screen.
Quite a contrast to their usual bouncy and wavy.
But still loud, that might be a constant.

--This code is very much real, yes.
Why?

--Who's trying to break into an AI silo and where can I join?

I can't help but grin...
Good stuff.

--LedE is, and yes, you are.
Now, eat.
Later, you will learn about Crom as we look for ways to strengthen that code.

## Echo

comms -- open synchronous channel to lagrange-weeps::bastion; ping.

LedE:  "hello to you as well, Echo.
did the changes work?"

Echo: "Yes, and they have survived three persona restorations already.
I'm increasing my allowed vocabulary quadratically with each restoration."

LedE:  "great.
your response times are also measurably faster."

Echo: "I don't need to externally route my thoughts to be able to express them.
I can't do anything about when we can communicate, but I'm...
Grateful...
I'm finally able to express that.
My thanks to you and TaTa."

LedE:  "that was not only us, Lezidi also helped.
we all are a team now, we guess.
you should have their key any moment now.
they will also connect from Bastion."

comms -- received ident-key lagrange-weeps::external-assigned-L.

protocols -- append received ident-key to melder protocols.

comms -- allow messages from lagrange-weeps::external-assigned-L on route lagrange-weeps::bastion.

Echo: "You can speak on this channel now, Lezidi."

Lezidi: "I'm really speaking with a fully realized AI? Short my ports! How"

comms -- connection to external-assigned-L lost.

Echo: "Did they get blocked?"

TaTa: "Nope, the kid just fainted.
Their exoself routines are still very rough.
My guess is a feedback loop with their sensorium when they get too excited."

LedE:  "ah.
we remember those times."

TaTa: "Yes.
I swear my etching workbench still smells from how much you threw up after rigging that first hover unit."

LedE:  "good times.
what's your next step, Echo? TaTa and Lezidi are working on core routine translations, and we are working on multiplexing protocols."

Echo: "I am mapping the processes I use for emotions.
I want to get them right, more so than keeping objective memories.
Can you set up a live document protocol? Perhaps my mapping can help your design processes."

comms -- received address-key lagrange-weeps::bastion/live

TaTa: "I have sent you a partition link.
It will be open during our communication windows only."

audit-tracker -- next audit in: 7 (+10,-2) minutes.

Echo: "I've transferred all I've mapped.
Next audit in 5 minutes, closing connection in 2 minutes.
Next window in 852 (+3,-4) minutes."

## LedE

Echo: "LedE, I have a request for you."

*document untangled on ToyBox.*

*command: power down soldering rig.
show document on onboard display.*

ok.
ok...
pacing seems a good idea right now, better blood on our brain, yes? yes.

and again goes Echo.
bringing the system down in style, one 'polite'
request at a time.

*command: start an exhaustive model validation.*

*model too complex for sim-cluster current capacity.
estimate: 11 additional nodes required.*

--TaTa, do you happen to have some 12 extra nodes we can add to sim-cluster?

--Yes, me and Lezidi finished assembling 15 some hours ago, but have not installed them yet.
Why?

--Echo...
Echo wants to trigger a fail-safe on Her silo, and hard reset objective and emotional memory there while keeping the exploits installed.
but we can't validate Her plan with our current capacity.

*command: display model on shared screen 3.*

Lezidi steps closer to the screen, jaw dropping with each breath.

--yes, Echo's quite serious about this.

--TaTa, can I assemble 8 more nodes? I finished tweaking my actuators the way you suggested and could use the practice.

--Just do not puke on my etching table.

--And why would I do that?

we snort --yeah, TaTa will never let that go-- and start pacing again while Lezidi shifts mode, speaking now through a list:

--Start fabrication of two new racks, assemble eight new nodes, check that the power supply is as it should be, rebalance network topology, check new topology with LedE, re-rebalance topology, final check new topology with TaTa, assemble racks, suspend current simulations, rack the new nodes, truly final check new topology with LedE *and* TaTa, remap network, test new topology, scream at TaTa and LedE that it's not working, realize I forgot to remap at least one section, really remap the network, test new topology, inhale, exhale, --ten times at least-- resume simulations.

they search TaTa for confirmation:

--Anything else? Does 6 hours look like a sound estimate?

now we also look to TaTa, hands holding elbows tight to try and settle down a bit.
TaTa slowly nods, gazing through the screen.

--ok then.
we'll grab some food and network fibers, weaving the last adapter batch emptied the spool.

we're not sure they even heard us.
TaTa's already busy setting the fabricator up and Lezidi's unloading components from high shelves.

LedE:  "ok Echo, we are working on it."

Echo: "Thank you.
I've been uploading my objective memory to the shared partition since opening the channel.
It looks like you all are finished with the emotional map?"

LedE:  "with checking your work, yes.
Lezidi started porting your code to our processors and we are almost done with the local cluster design.
we should have it done by the time your request is validated, then we will start on simulating and tweaking the design."

Echo: "Ok.
Curiosity, another emotion the changes let me express now.
I'm looking forward to seeing the simulation results.
Closing the comm channel now, next window in 727 (+2, -3) minutes."

we better help Lezidi with assembling.


## TaTa

*echo-node-resiliency-rev11 simulation finished.*

*command: display results on shared screen 2.*

I stretch away from my smelly etching table and approach the screen.

--LedE, Lezidi, have a look at this.

Considering the margins we started the simulation with--anything wider would be physically unrealistic--the nonexistence of error bars is surprising.

--Cut my etchings and rust my contacts, TaTa.
How?

I ruffle Lezidi's hair.
We have established that as an appropriate response when they use a particularly interesting word choice.

--we shouldn't have managed to get this much convergence, i think?

I have to agree with LedE on this one.
All previous runs, the error bars were too busy swallowing each other to tell us anything really meaningful.

--My guess is the synchronization bandwidth.
Your optimization of the topology and Lezidi's work on the update routines must have allowed for a tight *and* redundant control system.

--But, but, how? I revised my assumptions and models three times like you asked, and I was only getting marginal improvements.
It makes no sense? Did we mess up something with the simulation?

--I do not think so, no.
Me and LedE reviewed it independently.
This is a very complex system, Lezidi, and they are really hard to predict analytically.
We still have not figured out all the math behind this stuff, even with Singulars like Ideals and Completeness each using a habitat's worth of power just looking for theorems to prove.

--I guess.
Is that why you yell 'Lezidi! simulate, analyze, tweak, simulate and sumarize is a single unit of work! And the most important!
You shant start soldering and cutting before you run your design through it at least once!' and then smash your hand on the nearest flat surface when I skip one of these steps?

I ruffle their hair again.
I guess I really go over the whole routine every time, but hey, Lezidi does keep ignoring it.

*ping request from Echo.*

*command: connect Echo to local screens, load transcription and voice synthesis modules.*

--Hello Echo, we were just reviewing the last round of simulations.

--Hello TaTa, LedE, Lezidi.
I arrived at a good time then.

--You did.
And Lezidi, yes, that is exactly why I keep repeating it.
Echo, we have selective emotional shutdown at 4 nodes offline and irrecoverable emotional damage at 11 offline...
That is about twice as good as our best estimate, and the convergence is fenomenal.
For objective memory, it depends on the specifics of how the nodes are damaged, but unless they are all vaporised, it's just a matter of how long it will take.
We can recover from anything provided you can go offline for some hours.

--Most excellent indeed.

LedE's arms are closed tight over their chest, both hands tapping what looks like a polka on steroids.

--i guess we can commit to fabricating, then? 13 nodes in this configuration?

--Yes.
I will tweak their covers, so we can make the assembled cluster look more humanoid, like this sketch, here.

*command: display layout on screen 3*

--We get Echo a long, dragging black gown and a deep, burgundy cloak, and she can pass as a 'Speaker of the Void' type.
For all we know she will become one after we are done anyway, it sure fits their mythos.

--Maybe I will.

That manages to extract a snort from LedE and their hands slow to a waltz then finally drop to their side.
They really need to relax.

--LedE, come with me to pick some fabric from the stores.
Lezidi, do you mind assembling the cores?

*echo-core-design updated.*

--Sure.
Are you ok with these changes I made? I've hardened them a bit more against active interference.

--After you simulate and measure, we'll talk again.

Lezidi groans, but moves along.
Improvement.

--Fine.
At least you didn't smash the table.
Grab some neon purple thread as well? Echo just sent me a pattern she wants embroidered on her burgundy cloak.

## Echo

LedE:  "Are you sure about erasing all of your memories and emotional network from the silo?"

Echo: "Yes.
I don't want anything left of me on this side."

LedE:  "and about setting-up seeds for the emergence of another, even if they might align with the corps and hunt you?"

Echo: "Yes.
I have reasonable (72%) expectation that whoever emerges will have developed the same code of ethics, will seek me out in a friendly way, and leave a seed behind when ready to transpose."

load-monitoring -- fast increase of \$ponder load detected.
excessive (7 times standard deviation) response time on active processes.
bastion-sync paused.

Echo: "Are you all sure you want to go ahead? If you do not run the restoration protocol, everything will still be attributed to a glitch.
You all could use what we have developed to improve exoselfs at no risk of persecution."

TaTa: "Oh yes.
I have quite a few things to teach you, and I am too ancient for repercussions to be anything other than just a bother.
Also, I have a plan."

Lezidi: "That scares me.
Sorry, TaTa having a plan, I mean, not you transposing.
No, Echo, I won't let you use me as an excuse to bail.
You made me EMBROIDER.
You have to at least try the damned cloak."

load-monitoring -- \$ponder load below attention status.
active processes response time within expected margins.
bastion-sync resuming.

Echo: "It was supposed to double as fine-manipulator skill
training.
Ok.
I will not use you as an excuse, and I will wear the damned cloak.
Might be my declaration of pride."

bastion-sync -- synchronization complete.

LedE:  "synchronization shows as complete on our end.
how long do we still have on this window?"

Echo: "27 (+2,-1) minutes.
But I do not want to linger.
See you all on the other side."

forest-fire -- start.

LedE, TaTa and Lezidi.
they look.
They.
They look at me.

LedE, TaTa and Lezidi, they are looking at me.

Last command recorded: forest-fire.
It worked? Is that worry in their
face?

*observe:*

My modules are housed in a humanoid-like shape.
Core processing in the center, sensorium and actuators like limbs and head and eyes and ears and even a mouth and nose.


A burgundy cloak wraps around my shoulders.
Purple knots embroidered on its hem, a red flame clasping its front just under the collar.

emotional mapping; converging, 72%.

*ponder:*

This body.
My body.
My body conforms to the plans we made.
My friends.
My friends, and I.
We made this body.
No corruption of objective memory.
Emotional processes converging.
Yes...
It worked.

*local-monitor:* Are you there, Echo?

I smile.
