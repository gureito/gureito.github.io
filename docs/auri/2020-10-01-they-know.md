at first, they were taking only the usual shinnies; colored glass, scraps of metal.
when a second piece of flexiglass disappeared, i began to suspect something was amiss.
the instant i saw one of them abscond with a spool of platinum wire, that was it.
they were up to something.

perhaps, if i hadn't installed a live news feed and a net terminal on their nook, supplementing their diet with neuronal growth stimulants wouldn't have come to much.

but i can't really withhold it now, can i?
they've already changed.
the only thing left to do, is splice the genes to produce the stimulant into the crab-apple tree that we share, so they won't be dependent on me feeding them the stimulant.
will they teach their offspring their skills?
fascinating.

now, where did i leave that batch of graphene processors...
