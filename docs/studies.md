to me, an study is a short flash-fiction that i write to explore a theme, place, or character.
i try to not expend much time on each of them, and research isn't really involved, the initial writing is almost always a `dump what's on my mind` kind of deal, that i sometimes come back later to expand into proper story attempts.
