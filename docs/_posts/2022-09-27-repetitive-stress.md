```poetry
i fall
eyes finding stars
night wings, tar hands, sharp teeth
i crash, they fade, swirling remains
i rise

i drop
eyes search the sky
circling, reaching, screeching
i crash, they remain, fog no more
i'll try

i...
eyes forlorn
they nip, grab, bite, tear
i forget light, forsake life
we...

we see
its fearful tumble down the cliff
night wings, tar hands, sharp teeth
we launch skyward
we'll eat
```
