wondering what waltzing was like in the days before the beginning, *sparrow* nonetheless waltz with their partner.
inside their suit, red flashes and amber trajectories warn of impending danger.
sharing a thought, *sparrow* and partner spin away, circles and spirals weaving an evasion pattern.
will it draw the attackers deeper into the trap?

a jolt brings *sparrow* back from their musings and then scrambling for cover.
the massive STALKER that just missed its deadly pounce --that's what waltzing is for in these days after the end-- calls for a different approach.
trusting the CHARGERs to other couples, *sparrow* springs out of cover.

wondering what a sparrow looked like before, *sparrow* and partner flit about, burning strong.
its massive body unable to keep up with their reckless flight, the STALKER becomes prey.
almost brushing by it, they order a full ordnance release.

~ TARGET NEUTRALIZED ~

*sparrow* relaxes.
not that there's anything else to do, with all their power gone now.
and the STALKER is immobilized anyway.
what did they do, after waltzing, in those days long gone?
