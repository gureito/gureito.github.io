Is there a name for a phobia of praise?
Other than anxiety, I mean.

My fear of praise interlocks with a need of recognition.
This hunger for acknowledgment -- a sediment layer: a strata of residuum deep and old -- weights me down.
Yet... 
I am nothing -- not even ephemeral -- if not acknowledged by another.
I can hear Hegel snickering.
Would I never had read him.

Oh, praise...
I ride the high it gives me -- recognized, acknowledged, alive -- for I know the crash comes.

They expect things from me now.
The anticipation of failure settles: seeping, seizing.

Just like that.
I'm gone.
