i confess, i have a more selfish reason.
to talk with my demons.
not exorcise or excise them, nothing so violent.
but just coax them out of hiding, bring them to a place i can see them.
and in seeing them, instead of just hearing their moans and warnings on the back of my head, we can engage in some form of cooperation.

they do have valid points, you know.

sometimes.

i just need not be afraid of them.
