excerpt: October, which one?
---
```
step; swipe my feet.
reach; smash my hand.
gasp; clog my mouth.
scream; crush my chest.
Snow burns my skin, sun scares my eyes, wind…
The wind still speaks to me.

                   Ipê flowers under my feet.
                    Aspen leaves dot the sky.
                          October, which one?
```
