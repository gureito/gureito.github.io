Mona drifted through the crowd. Or was it the other way around?
It was difficult to guess, almost impossible to know for sure.
For Mona is pretty sure he's a ghost.
Interestingly enough, Mona has yet to find a way to glide through walls...
He learned right at the start that people easy to fool into believing he was not there.
But walls, they held strongly to the belief that that people should not walk through them.

Wondering about the ontological consequences of ghosts still being people, Mona kept drifting through crowds, not realizing the other possible conclusion.

Mona was not a ghost at all.
