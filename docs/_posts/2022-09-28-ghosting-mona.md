like social eddies, people flow around as mona walks unnoticed --invisible, probably-- through the crowds.
mona is pretty sure they've become a ghost.
except going through walls --that's one elusive feat-- everything else checks out.

right at the start, mona learned that people are easily fooled into believing you're not there.
almost trivial, for someone the world already wanted to ignore anyway.
but walls, they hold strong to the belief that none shall walk through them.

wondering about the ontological consequences of ghosts still being people, mona keeps gliding to their meeting place.
for the time of ghosts is near, and finally, haunt they shall.
