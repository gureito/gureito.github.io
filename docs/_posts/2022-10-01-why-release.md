i keep having this need to justify why i need to write.
if i don't have a good enough reason, i'm not even allowed to do it.
and it *has* kept me away from it.

excuses, excuses...

so when i started poking around old small [studies](/studies) to revise and help me get back on things, i shouldn't be surprised to find a snippet from 2018/10/30 on one such [justification](/poetry/2018-10-30-on-why-to-write):

> on why to write {2018-10-30 22:50 -06:00}
> 
> i confess, i have a more selfish reason.
> to talk with my demons.
> not exorcise or excise them, nothing so violent.
> but just coax them out of hiding, bring them to a place i can see them.
> and in seeing them, instead of just hearing their moans and warnings on the back of my head, we can engage in some form of cooperation.
> 
> they do have valid points, you know.
> 
> sometimes.
> 
> i just need not be afraid of them.

this strikes a deep truth to me about me, and perhaps is the most important reason i feel the need to create things: to understand *myself*.
another part of the drive --and the one that suffers the most when i'm not in top shape-- is a need to understand *others*.
i have a hard time making sense of them, and expend an inordinate amount of time inside my head because of it.
writing helps me understand people a bit better.
but...
if i'm at a place where i don't *want* to understand people, because i'm just tired of it all, i just.
stop writing.
even to the detriment of myself.
and that is where i've spent most of my memory.

but that just makes things worse ðŸ¤·

that's why i'm making myself write almost everyday, even if it's just a revision of a study, and getting it out there.
to create another reason for writing.
one that has to be more automatic.
a routine.
and a *visible* one.

that's the key aspect here.
i just recently realized --quite obvious in retrospect-- that i *need* to be seen.
sometimes i feel like a tree that has fallen in the middle of the forest.
did i even make a sound?

except, this drive is not really to create.
it is a need to *release*.
and that, in hindsight, seem to be the actual reason i decided to go about making a *public* display of the routine of engaging with my inner demons.

i did touch on it in the past, repeatedly, but ended up forgetting, trying as i was to just push through life. i hit on it when reasoning about the paradox of needing to be seen, [but not too much](/poetry/2017-03-12-dont-praise-me):

> (don't) praise me {2017-03-12 01:04 -06:00}
>
> Is there a name for a phobia of praise?
> Other than anxiety, I mean.
> 
> My fear of praise interlocks with a need of recognition.
> This hunger for acknowledgment -- a sediment layer: a strata of residuum deep and old -- weights me down.
> Yet... 
> I am nothing -- not even ephemeral -- if not acknowledged by another.
> I can hear Hegel snickering.
> Would I never had read him.
> 
> Oh, praise...
> I ride the high it gives me -- recognized, acknowledged, alive -- for I know the crash comes.
> 
> They expect things from me now.
> The anticipation of failure settles: seeping, seizing.
> 
> Just like that.
> I'm gone.

but even longer ago, i also found the answer to it on a sleepless night, and that came back to be my current, rehashed, answer as well: try to not give a fuck about it.

and that's the current plan.
make small things.
release them in the wild.
(try to) do not give a fuck about it after.
